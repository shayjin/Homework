    <p> The Game of Set is a card game. </p>
    <p>The deck consists of 81 cards of 4 features: <b>number, color, shape, and shading</b>. The game starts by dealing 12 cards.</p>
    <p>Number: 1, 2, 3</p>
    <p>Color: Red, Purple, Green</p>
    <p>Shape: Diamond Squiggly, Oval</p>
    <p>Shading: Solid, Striped, Open</p>
    <p>The rules are simple: you must find 3 cards on the table that form a set: each individual characteristic is either the <b>exact same</b>, or <b>all different</b>.</p>
    <p>In other words, you must avoid having 2 cards showing 1 version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.</p>
    <p>For example, if each card was green and each shape is a circle, then it follows the quantities are 1,2,3 and the shade is empty,half-full, and full in order for it to be a set.</p>
    <p>After finding a set, the cards you found will be removed and 3 more cards will be dealt to keep 12 cards on the table.</p>
    <p>If a set does not exists on the table, 3 more cards will be dealt again (15 cards on the table).</p>
    <p>The game is over when no sets are left to be found.</p>
