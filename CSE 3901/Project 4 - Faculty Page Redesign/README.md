# Project 4 : Faculty Page Redesign (Group 5)

The Ohio State University CSE 3901 Project 5: 

The goal of this project was to redesign Dr. Teodorescu's website. 
The original website can be found here: https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~teodorescu.1/

1. Install the appropriate bundle.

```
$ bundle install
```
2. To produce the website, run the program by typing:
```
$ bundle exec middleman server
```
3. A folder called build will show up in directory. Open index.html.
4. Also, in the terminal it should say "view your site at:" and then the two included http links will be the local port number hyperlink and then also the IP Address with the port number. It will also include links for site configuration. Simply clicking on these links (or right clicking to specify a browser to open with) will also open the web pages.

Originally our group designed the about us, research, presentations, publications, and tools pages. There were also dropdown menus and images that we included for each page and as we continued to add pages there were slight adjustments made to the css style sheet. 
After all of the HTML pages were finished, we then had to make some changes to the documents so that we used a middleman server to run the website. Originally the files were just HTML and these had to be adjusted for middleman to run properly.
